###PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project started with the plants on my balcony needing water every day.
Although the plants are all low- maintenance plants, the location and type of the balcony means they get dry very quick.
To solve this I picked up the idea to create an automated watering system.

####Scope
- Measure moisture levels of plants
- Regular moisturizing of plants
- Check water level in water container
- Air temperature check 
- Browser based interface showing all parameters
 
###PI INSTALLATION NOTES
- Set up SSH 
- Set up WIFI
- Set up shared folder 
- Use init.json to set up the GPIO ports
